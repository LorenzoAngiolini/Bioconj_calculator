# Application of Machine Learning models for the prediction of bioconjugation processes in the synthesis of antibody-drug conjugates.

This repository contains the code that enables users to input their own bioconjugation parameters (i.e, LP system in SMILES format, mAb, bioconjugation site, buffer) obtaining as output the bioconjugation conditions predicting the DAR values.

# Requirements 

This project was entirely developed with Python (version>=3.3). The required Python modules are:

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn
* RDKit
* XGBoost
* Sympy
* Datetime
* Openpyxl
